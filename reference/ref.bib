ABSTRACT={Biogeochemical- (BGC-) Argo aims to deploy and maintain a global array of autonomous profiling floats to monitor ocean biogeochemistry. With over 250,000 profiles collected so far, the BGC-Argo network is rapidly expanding toward the target of a sustained fleet of 1,000 floats. These floats prioritize the measurement of six key properties: oxygen, nitrate, pH, chlorophyll-a, suspended particles, and downwelling light. To assess the current biogeochemical state of the ocean, its variability, and trends with confidence, it is crucial to quality control these measurements. Accordingly, BGC-Argo maintains a quality control system using manual inspection and parameter-specific algorithms for flagging and adjusting data. In this study, we provide a census of the quantity and quality of measurements from BGC-Argo based on their quality flagging system. The purpose of this census is to assess the current status of the array in terms of data quality, how data quality has changed over time, and to provide a better understanding of the quality-controlled data to current and future users. Alongside increasing profile numbers and spatial coverage, we report that for most parameters between 80 and 95% of the profiles collected so far contain high-quality BGC data, with an exception for pH. The quality of pH profiles has seen a large improvement in the last five years and is on track to match the data quality of other BGC parameters. We highlight how BGC-Argo is improving and discuss strategies to increase the quality and quantity of BGC profiles available to users. This census shows that tracking percentages of high-quality data through time is useful for monitoring float sensor technology and helpful for ensuring the long-term success of BGC-Argo.}}

abstract = {Abstract Over 60 years of oceanographic observations from Ocean Station Papa (OSP) in the northeast Pacific indicate faster dissolved oxygen loss than the global average. The greatest negative trends in oxygen concentration occur on isopycnals in the upper water column (σθ = 26.1–26.8 kg m−3, ∼110–200 m) but have considerable uncertainty due to natural variability. In this paper, we use eight Argo profiling floats equipped with optode oxygen sensors to assess the 2008–2016 interannual variability of subsurface dissolved oxygen near OSP. We developed a method using high frequency Conductivity-Temperature-Depth data to correct optode profiles for slow response times and used reference profiles from the OSP time series to calibrate the optodes. Response time correction markedly improves subsurface bias caused by slow optode equilibration. Our analysis indicates that episodic shoaling of isopycnals can cause rapid reduction in dissolved oxygen concentration. Changes in ventilation, horizontal mixing, and water mass age are unlikely drivers for the rapid O2 loss events examined. We link dissolved oxygen loss during shoaling events to organic matter export, due to higher concentrations of organic matter and greater respiration rates at shallower depths. Reduced net community production during the “Blob” marine heatwave may have reduced the impact of the second shoaling event examined. Natural variations in dissolved oxygen in these layers provide context for uncertainty estimates of long-term trends and insight toward the potential for future extreme oxygen minima from the combined impact of the long-term decline and episodic shoaling.},

abstract = {Abstract The ocean oxygen (O2) inventory has declined in recent decades but the estimates of O2 trend are uncertain due to its sparse and irregular sampling. A refined estimate of deoxygenation rate is developed using machine learning techniques and biogeochemical Argo array. The source data includes historical shipboard (bottle and CTD-O2) profiles from 1965 to 2020 and biogeochemical Argo profiles after 2005. Neural network and random forest algorithms were trained using approximately 80\% of this data and the remaining 20\% for validation. The training data is further divided into 5-fold decadal groups to perform cross validation and hyperparameter tuning. Through different combinations of algorithm types and predictor variable sets, an ensemble of gridded monthly O2 data sets was generated with similar skills (root-mean-square error ∼13–18 μmol/kg and R2 ∼ 0.9). The largest errors are found in the oxycline and frontal regions with strong lateral and vertical gradients. The mapping was repeated with shipboard data only and with both shipboard and Argo data. The effect of including Argo data on the estimated global deoxygenation trends has a major impact with an 56\% increase while reducing the uncertainty by 40\% as measured by the ensemble spread. This study demonstrates the importance of new biogeochemical Argo arrays in relatively data-poor regions such as the Southern Ocean.},

ABSTRACT={The Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) project has deployed 194 profiling floats equipped with biogeochemical (BGC) sensors, making it one of the largest contributors to global BGC-Argo.  Post-deployment quality control of float-based oxygen, nitrate, and pH data is a crucial step in the processing and dissemination of such data, as in-situ chemical sensors remain in early stages of development.  In-situ calibration of chemical sensors on profiling floats using atmospheric reanalysis and empirical algorithms can bring accuracy to within 3 µmol O2 kg-1, 0.5 µmol NO3- kg-1, and 0.007 pH units.  Routine quality control efforts utilizing these methods can be conducted manually through visual inspection of data to assess sensor drifts and offsets, but more automated processes are preferred to support the growing number of BGC floats and reduce subjectivity among delayed-mode operators.  Here we present a methodology and accompanying software designed to easily visualize float data against select reference datasets and assess quality control adjustments within a quantitative framework.  The software is intended for global use and has been used successfully in the post-deployment calibration and quality control of over 250 BGC floats, including all floats within the SOCCOM array.  Results from validation of the proposed methodology are also presented which help to verify the quality of the data adjustments through time.}}

abstract = {The biological transformation of dissolved inorganic carbon to organic carbon during photosynthesis in the ocean, marine primary production, is a fundamental driver of biogeochemical cycling, ocean health and Earth’s climate system. The organic matter created supports oceanic food webs, including fisheries, and is an essential control on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Marine primary productivity is sensitive to changes due to climate forcing, but observing the response at the global scale remains a major challenge. Sparsely distributed productivity measurements are made using samples collected and analysed on research vessels. However, there are never enough ships and scientists to enable direct observations at the global scale with seasonal to annual resolution. Today, global ocean productivity is estimated using remote-sensing ocean-colour observations or general circulation models with coupled biological models that are calibrated with the sparse shipboard measurements. Here we demonstrate the measurement of gross oxygen production by photosynthesis using the diel cycle of oxygen concentration detected with the array of Biogeochemical-Argo profiling floats. The global ocean net primary productivity computed from this data is 53 Pg C y-1, which will be an important constraint on satellite and general circulation model-based estimates of the ocean productivity.},

abstract = {The distributions of dissolved O2 and CO2 have not previously been systematically compared across the global surface ocean, despite their significance for life and climate. Here we analyze carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations relative to saturation (equilibrium with the atmosphere) in surface waters, using two large datasets (ship-collected and float-collected data). When applied to a high-quality global ship-collected dataset, CO2 and O2 concentrations relative to saturation exhibit large seasonal and geographic variations. However, linear fits of CO2 and O2 deviations from saturation (ΔCO2 against ΔO2) yield y-intercepts close to zero, which suggests a requirement for data validity. We utilize this finding to investigate the accuracy of carbonate system data from biogeochemical-Argo floats. We find significant discrepancies in ΔCO2-ΔO2 y-intercepts compared to the global reference, implying overestimations of float-based CO2 release in the Southern Ocean. We conclude that this technique can be applied to data from autonomous platforms for quality assessment.},

abstract = {Accurate monitoring of the long-term trend of oxygen content at global scale requires a better knowledge of the regional oxygen variability at interannual to decadal time scale. Here, we combined the Argo dataset and repeated ship-based sections to investigate the drivers of the oxygen variability in the North Atlantic Ocean, a key region for the oxygen supply into the deep ocean. We focus on the Labrador Sea Water in the Irminger Sea over the period 1991–2018 and we show that the oxygen solubility explains less than a third of the oxygen variability. In turn, the main drivers of the oxygen variability are due to changes in vertical mixing, advection, and other processes as revealed by Apparent Oxygen Utilization computation. Our findings revealed the key role of physical processes on the changes in oxygen variability and highlight the need of keeping a sustained monitoring of those processes to disentangle human-induced changes in oxygen from decadal natural variability.},
